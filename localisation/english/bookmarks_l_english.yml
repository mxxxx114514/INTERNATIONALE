 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "18 years ago, when the Central Powers and the Entente signed an armstice, the war had ended with no victors. With a still powerful Germany not fully defeated, the Treaty of Versailles had turned out to be comparatively tolarent. This left France as the true loser of the war, and soon the oppressed French workers rose up. This lead to the success of the World Revolutionaires in Moscow, and Trotsky rose to power. As 1936 arrives, it seemed that Germany is the only capitalist power left in Europe to stop the red flood. A second World War is coming."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. As the French turns left, the Entente Cordiale had been shattered. The country now faces the prospect of another: the great red menace from Paris, Moscow, and all around the globe. Would the ruler of the waves need to seek the support of their former foe, Germany, for a war against the revolutionaries?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France had contributed the most in the Great War, yet what they got was the betrayal from the British, a newly risen German Federation, and the communists taking our homeland. With the Third Republic fleeing to Northen Africa, it could barely hold its tremendous colonial empire. Could the dying Republic return to Paris after emerging victorious after the second round, or will it disintegrate after the communist ideology spread to the other side of the Mediterranean? "
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Eighteen yearsago, the world was locked in a stalemate during a major war. However, the successive collapses of the allies in late 1918 left the German Empirestrategically surrounded. In December 1918, soldiers from both sides of the Hindenburg Line, who had been facing each other, staged large-scale mutinies and spontaneously celebrated Christmas together. Anti-war protests also eruptedin England, France, and Germany. Finally, the imperial government made thebiggest compromise by agreeing to surrender Alsace-Lorraine, thus ending the war.\n\n In the chaotic post-war world, France, Italy, and Hungary, just like Russia in 1917,experienced communist revolutions, completely destroying the new internationalsystem negotiated upon Versailles. Meanwhile, Germany, after annexing Austria,continued to recover and enjoy a prosperous golden twenties.\n\nHowever, as the collapse of the U.S. stock market in 1929 quickly spread to Europe, the Germaneconomy was severely damaged. Meanwhile, the Third International continued tostrengthen its military forces, creating a three-front encirclement situation.Germany was on the brink of another seven-year war. Would it become last beacon of liberalism in continental Europe? "
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, Italy has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Italian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been Italy's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Russian Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Russian Empire. After the success of the Second French Revolution, every Bolshevik was determined in a Global Revolution and to bring to the destruction of the Capitalists once and for all. With the leadership of Lev Trotsky, the Soviets had already contributed in the creation of a communist China, and soon they shall bring the revolution to every corner of this planet."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States is still in isolation. With the German-supported neutralists, America had never got the chance to intervene in the Great War. Though it enjoyed a peaceful period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties, the nation was hit hard by the Great Depression in 1929.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but the United States would soon realize the threat of the communist revolutions around the world. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. With the power of the Internationale stronger than ever, should Poland need to seek alliance with Germany, or should it continue to withstand the Red Giant alone?
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 SWI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Switzerland is unique among the nations of Europe. It stands as a multicultural and decentralized nation founded on the principles of mutual respect and support.\n\nIts staunchly held neutrality survived the Great War, and after seeing its horrors from a distance, it's more convinced than ever of its need to defend itself. As the shadow of war looms closer, this peaceful nation must choose whether to remain neutral and deter any invaders through Armed Neutrality, to form a reluctant alliance with one of its neighbors, or to proactively defeat her enemies before they dare consider interloping."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nAs tensions grew, both Extreme Nationalists and Communists are rising. Could Regent Horthy hold his power anymore?"
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new State of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Established in 1921, the Chinese Communist Party had aimed to construct a united socialist China, free from invasions from the West and Japan. Now in 1936, with the support of the Big Brother in Moscow, this dream had been consolidated. Chiang Kai Shek? Warlords? They had all become history. With all of China except for Tibet and Mongolia unified, Mao had planned to bring his "Continuous Revolution" around the world. Even though the threat of the Japanese are still existant, Trotsky had granted full support for Beijing. If its potentials could be fully released, China could play a big role --  and even win -- the Second World War."
 MEXICO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico faced two decades of civil wars after the overthrow of the tyrant Porfirio Díaz. Centralizers fought regionalists, peasants and socialists rallied against hacienda landlords, and battles over the role of state versus religion came out of the annals of the Enlightenment to terrorize Mexico.\n\nThe secularist government insists that it won these battles, but it is seated on a throne of debris. After Mexico is rebuilt, perhaps a different victor will have emerged."
 NETHERLANDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Dutch government eyes the mounting global tensions with concern. Between an ailing economy, a powerful pacifist movement, and a firm belief in neutrality to the point of driving potential allies away, they are unable to properly prepare their defenses.\n\nAt the same time, the importance of the Netherlands as a gateway of trade into the continent means that both the British and the Germans desire Dutch 'cooperation' to thwart the other, and may take rejection as a reason for hostility. Perhaps withdrawal to the colonies is the only possible means to resist such an invasion..."
 SPAIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the first five years of its existence, the fledgling Second Spanish Republic has already had to deal with strikes, a military coup attempt, and a major revolutionary uprising. Though it has survived these challenges, Spanish society continues to be marred by political polarization and violence between anarchists, communists, and falangists.\n\nBoth sides look towards the upcoming 1936 general election with hopeful eyes, but it is unlikely that the victory of either side will bring a return to stability. And as the violence continues, the military waits and plots..."
 PORTUGAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Salazar's rise to power in 1932, Portugal has been gradually distancing herself from the unstable period of the First Republic. Fiscal Autonomy and Political Independence from the major powers led to the creation of the Estado Novo, laying the foundations for the development of the Portuguese industry and the modernization of the army. \n\nNow, Portugal must decide the way forward as political and social instability increases in neighboring Spain and international tensions are hopelessly worsening..."
 LIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With a Poland still thirsting to entrap Lithuania in a new Commonwealth, the Soviets failing to acknowledge Lithuania's right to self-determination, and a seemingly peaceful yet still powerful German neighbor, a veteran from the independence war has risen to preserve the stability and independence of the Lithuanian nation. With the limited resources at his disposal, Antanas Smetona sits at the head of an unstable regime; with the fascist Iron Wolf paramilitary prowling the countryside, enraged by the imprisonment of their leader: Augustinas Voldemares. With war on the horizon, Lithuania must defend her people, no matter the cost."
 BAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "The Baltic Union had originated in the Estonian and Latvian Wars for independence from Soviet Russia. With the support of Germany, the two had united and became close allies with Berlin. Although the new country was steadily developing, it was still challenging to maintain the young Union and to withstand the threat from the east."
 BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Liberation War of 1878 and the rejection of the San Stefano Treaty by Western democracies, Bulgaria has lived through a long history of conflict and betrayal in the Balkans. As a defeated member of the Central Powers in the Great War, Bulgaria suffered heavy territorial losses and the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine imposed harsh economic sanctions and severe military restrictions. \n\nBut with the major political and social changes taking place in Europe, it is time for Bulgaria to choose its own path and find its rightful place in the Balkans."
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Greece is a nation in crisis. Royalists and republicans have perpetuated a fervent struggle for the nation's soul which resulted in the abolition of the Second Hellenic Republic in 1935. The king, an autocratic foreigner, remains a highly divisive figure with an uncertain future. \n\nDistracted by petty domestic politics, a malignant and revanchist Bulgaria has been allowed to fester in the north, while Greece’s long-time nemesis and new-found ally Turkey undergoes a political metamorphosis to the east, and that is to say nothing of the stirring monster on the other side of the Adriatic..."
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "From the ashes of the Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Turkey was born. Turkish independence was won with blood and bullets in the National Campaign of 1923, and while the struggle was righteous the cost continues to weigh heavily upon the Turkish people. \n\nReligious conservatives plague the hinterlands and resist nation-wide modernization efforts in the strongest terms, while Kurdish nationalists wreak havoc in the east of the country. Lionized president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk must unite the country or pass the torch to a leader who can, and they must do it soon as trouble stirs in Europe..."
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ethiopia has a history stretching back centuries and an imperial dynasty to match. While Haile Selassie has made great strides to modernize the empire, the process has been interrupted as Ethiopia finds itself under attack from Italy for the second time in 40 years. The situation is bleak, but if the empire pulls together, it can halt the invaders once again. \n\nFor Ethiopia to remain free, the whole of East-Africa must be liberated from the yoke of European rule, once and for all."
